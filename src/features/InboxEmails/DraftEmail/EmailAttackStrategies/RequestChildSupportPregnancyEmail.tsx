                Hey there,
            </p>
            <p>
                I know you may not have remembered me, but I am that
                lady you banged up real good in that bar accross town a few
                weeks ago. Bad news, I'M PREGNANT! I know you feel terrible 
                about this, I know you are a good man at heart, which is why
                I come to you with a proposition today.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am due in a little over 4 weeks now, and I really need 
                some help paying my bills for the next little while, and if 
                you could help out any way you can, that would be great. I really
                need $750 to pay for my rent this month, I am really stretched thin.
                If you could help me out by wiring that or any money over, I would 
                greatly appreciate it. I know you are a good man at heart.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thank you so much,
            </p>
