                Good morning relative, 
            </p>
            <p>
                It is great to hear from you! I don't know if you heard,
                but your uncle Jimmiy got in a bit of a hairy drunken fight
                with a cop the other night, and he is in the local jail in 
                pretty bad shape, and I don't have the money to bail him out. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Could you do me a favor with this? He is in very poor shape, and
                needs to get out. If you could just wire $500 over to him in order
                to get him out, him and I would definitely appreciate it, if you
                can't send all of it, that's fine, he just really needs to get out.
            </p>
            <p>
                Much love,
            </p>
