                Hey there!
            </p>
            <p>
                I have some pretty compromising pictures of you and me that
                you sent to my phone the other night! If you don't send me 
                $250 by tomorrow, I have ways of sending this to some people
                who you REALLY don't want to see this.
            </p>
            <p>
                Wire the money to me as soon as possible, your compliance is 
                much appreciated.
            </p>
